All my important setups from my home directory.

# VIM

## Requirements

I'm using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as my plugin manager.
No need to do anything, there's an auto install script at the beginning of the
`.vimrc` file.

## Installation

1. Copy the `.vimrc` file to the home folder
2. Open Vim (Skip errors if any)

It will install all the necessary plugins.
