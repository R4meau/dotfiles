# VIM

## Requirements

I'm using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as my plugin manager.

## Installation

1. Copy the `.vimrc` file to the home folder
2. Open Vim (Skip errors if any) and get into `NORMAL` mode
3. Type and enter the following command: `:PlugInstall`

It will install all the necessary plugins.

### Note

I'm not sure yet if this is the right process on a new computer. I'll update
this README after testing it.
